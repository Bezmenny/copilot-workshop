# Tasks

## Task 1: Setup short keys
IntelliJ: Go to `Settings > Keymap > Plugins > GitHub Copilot` and set a short key for `Show Next/Previous Completions` and `Show Completions`

VSCode: Go to `Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts` and set a short key for `GitHub Copilot: Show Next/Previous Completions` and `GitHub Copilot: Show Completions`

## Task 2: How to use autocomplete
Open the `hello_world.java` dummy file.
We want the class to print a description of what it does after it printed `Hello World!`.
You as a user don't want to write more than 4 letters to get the desired result.
Hint: There are multiple ways, and it is even possible with only 1 letter.

## Task 3: Starting prompting
We want to write a parser for German telephone numbers.
Create a new file and write a prompt in a comment.
Hint: Remember what Copilot uses as context to better solve a task. You might need to use the suggestion sidebar.

## Task 4: Refine the prompt to get a better solution
Most probably you got that looks quite complicated and uses a lot of code.
You want to refine the prompt to get a better solution using regexes.

## Task 5: Write a test
You want to test the parser: Write a prompt to create a test for the parser.
Have a look if you can use prompting to create testdata as well.


## Task 6: Let Copilot explain the code
Open the file `secret.java` and let Copilot explain the code to you by letting it write comments.
What is the purpose of the code? What is the input and what is the output?

## Task 7: Refactor the code
As you could see the code uses recursion. You want to refactor the code to not use recursion anymore.
How could you solve this by using just one prompt in comment?

## Task 8: Letting Copilot fix a bug
Open `guess_number.java` and let Copilot fix the bug in the code.
This task is quite hard most of the time via a prompt, so don't be disappointed if it doesn't work out.
Via Copilot Chat it should work out most of the time.

## Showcase: How Chat will make some tasks shown above easier.
